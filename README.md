# python_assignment_4
This assignment focuses on File Handling in Python, along with proper use of exception handling (try-except) to make the program user-friendly and error-proof. You are required to perform two main tasks that demonstrate reading, writing, and appending to text files.
Task 1: Writing to a File
The program asks the user to enter some text.

This text is then written to a file named output.txt using write ('w') mode.

If the file doesn't exist, it is automatically created.

A success message is displayed after writing.

Concepts covered: open(), 'w' mode, writing data, exception handling.

 Task 2: Appending and Reading the File
The user is asked to enter more text to add to the same file.

This input is then appended to the file using 'a' mode.

Finally, the program opens the file in read mode and prints all its content line by line.

 Concepts covered: open() with 'a' and 'r' mode, reading lines, strip(), exception handling, user interaction.
